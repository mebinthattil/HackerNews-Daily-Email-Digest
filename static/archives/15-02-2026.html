            NewPipe is an open‑source, free YouTube client. The package lacks a published hash sum and uses a signing key with SHA‑256 fingerprint CB:84:06:9B:D6:81:16:BA:FA:E5:EE:4E:E5:B0:8A:56:7A:A6:D8:98:40:4E:7C:B1:2F:9E:75:6D:F5:CF:5C:AB. Visual assets illustrate the app’s interface and distribution channels: the NewPipe logo, a “get NewPipe” button, operation on a Fairphone, offline playback, privacy‑focused design, background playlist support, a popup player, subscription list, bookmark view, watch history, and a developer thumbnail. Additional images show the NewPipe icon, links to its F‑Droid repository (including URL and logo), a “get it on F‑Droid” badge, and the GitHub project page. These elements convey the client’s functionality, privacy emphasis, and availability through F‑Droid and GitHub.

            The GitHub repository i5heu/ublock-hide-yt-shorts provides a maintained filter list for the uBlock Origin ad‑blocking extension. Its explicit purpose is to block or hide YouTube Shorts content when uBlock Origin is active, allowing users to prevent Shorts from appearing in the YouTube interface. The project is hosted on GitHub under the i5heu account and is presented as an ongoing, maintained resource for this specific filtering task. An access message—“You can’t perform that action at this time”—appears within the page, indicating a permission or rate‑limit restriction when attempting certain operations on the site. No additional content, documentation, or usage instructions are included in the provided excerpt.

              Comments express widespread frustration with YouTube’s limited user control, especially regarding mandatory Shorts, recommendation algorithms, and automatic quality reductions, even for paying subscribers. Users commonly share and recommend extensions, filter lists, and custom scripts (e.g., Unhook, uBlock Origin, Blocktube, FreeTube, SponsorBlock) to hide Shorts, ads, and unwanted content, while some note occasional appreciation for Shorts’ brevity. The dominant view is that YouTube prioritizes engagement and ad revenue over user preferences, prompting many to adopt third‑party tools or abandon the platform altogether.

            News publishers are restricting the Internet Archive (IA) to prevent AI companies from scraping their content. The Guardian has excluded its article pages from IA’s APIs and Wayback Machine URL listings, while still allowing regional homepages. The Financial Times blocks all bots, including those from OpenAI, Anthropic, Perplexity and IA; only unpaywalled stories appear in the Wayback Machine. The New York Times “hard‑blocks” the IA crawler via robots.txt, and Reddit has limited IA’s access to Reddit data. IA’s robots.txt currently welcomes crawlers, though it uses internal rate‑limiting and Cloudflare protection. Analyses show the Wayback Machine was used in Google’s C4 dataset and Meta’s Llama training. A survey of 1,167 news sites found 241 explicitly disallow at least one IA bot—87 % of these are USA Today (Gannett) outlets, with additional blocks by Le Monde sites. Most of the same sites also block Common Crawl, OpenAI, and Google AI bots, reflecting publishers’ concern that IA’s bulk access can serve as a backdoor for unauthorized AI training.

              Comments express strong concern that news publishers are blocking archival services to protect revenue and prevent AI training use, which many see as threatening the public historical record. There is broad agreement that independent, reliable preservation mechanisms are needed, with suggestions ranging from open‑source self‑hosted tools to government‑backed search archives and crowd‑sourced browser extensions. Some participants argue that archival restrictions mainly serve commercial interests and risk knowledge erosion, while a minority view the loss of content as acceptable or even beneficial. Overall, the discussion emphasizes the tension between monetization, AI scraping, and long‑term access to information.

            The author thanks ArchWiki maintainers for their under‑recognized contributions to free‑software documentation, noting that the Wiki is routinely consulted for a wide range of tools—including email clients, editors, and window managers—across Arch and other distributions. It is credited with providing configuration tips and clarifying software features that are often missing from upstream documentation, and it serves as a primary troubleshooting resource when setting up GNU/Linux systems for personal contacts. The post references a meeting at FOSPED (2025/2026) with Arch Project Leader Levente, ArchWiki maintainer Ferdinand (Alad), and FSFE vice‑president Heiki, where the author presented them with “hacker chocolate.” A quoted tweet from Edward Snowden is used to emphasize the rarity of reliable search results outside ArchWiki. The author encourages public acknowledgment and donations to support the Wiki’s continued reliability.

            IBM is tripling its entry‑level hiring, focusing on Gen Z graduates, despite AI’s ability to automate many junior tasks. HR chief Nickle LaMoreaux says the move will reshape roles: software engineers will shift from routine coding to customer interaction, and HR staff will work with chatbots rather than answer every query, building AI fluency and durable skills. IBM argues that cutting early‑career positions risks a future shortage of mid‑level managers and higher recruitment costs. CEO Arvind Krishna supports increased graduate hiring, though the company also announced modest layoffs affecting a low single‑digit percent of its global workforce, leaving U.S. headcount roughly unchanged. Other tech firms echo this strategy; Dropbox plans a 25 % expansion of its internship and graduate programs, citing Gen Z’s superior AI proficiency, while Cognizant’s CEO Ravi Kumar S. pledges more school‑graduate hires, viewing AI as an amplifier rather than a displacement tool. AI literacy is now the fastest‑growing skill in the U.S., according to LinkedIn.

              Comments convey a cautious view of AI’s workplace impact. Users acknowledge that large‑language models can streamline routine tasks and free modest time, but most report only incremental efficiency gains and little change in overall output. Claims of substantial productivity boosts are seen as overstated, with metrics often questioned. Companies’ shift toward hiring more junior staff is interpreted as either leveraging AI‑augmented junior productivity or as cost‑cutting that may devalue senior roles, while concerns about age‑related layoffs and broader labor effects persist. The consensus is that AI is a useful aid, not a near‑term replacement for knowledge workers.

            A Kickstarter‑funded smart sleep mask includes EEG, respiration, accelerometer, gyroscope sensors, vibration, heating, audio playback, and periorbital electrical muscle stimulation (EMS). Using Claude, the author reverse‑engineered its Bluetooth Low Energy interface: two channels (commands and data) with a proprietary packet format (header, direction, command type, payload, footer). Decompiling the Flutter Android APK revealed hard‑coded MQTT broker credentials shared by all units. Connecting to the broker exposed live telemetry from ~25 devices, including EEG streams at 250 Hz, air‑quality metrics, and occupancy data. The mask’s EMS can be triggered via the same command set, allowing remote electrical stimulation of any user. The author built a web dashboard to control the mask (sliders for vibration, heating, EMS, audio) and captured EEG samples showing REM‑like mixed frequencies and deep‑sleep delta activity. The security flaw—public credentials and unencrypted MQTT publishing—permits unrestricted access to personal brainwave data and control of the device; the researcher notified the manufacturer but did not name the product.

              Comments converge on strong criticism of the sleep‑mask’s security, highlighting the shared MQTT credentials, lack of encryption and the broader “shambolic” state of IoT device protection. Many express skepticism about the plausibility of the advertised EEG, stimulation and battery capabilities, questioning whether such hardware can function as described. There is concern that LLMs lower the barrier to reverse‑engineering, potentially encouraging insecure product launches. Some suggest local‑only integrations as a mitigation, while a few note the need for clearer regulation and naming of the company.

              The comments express skepticism toward the reported benchmark results, requesting independent verification and clarification of the methods that yield the claimed performance advantage. They note the absence of comparisons with newer serverless vector databases such as Pinecone Serverless, Turbopuffer, and distributed Chroma, emphasizing the importance of evaluating cost versus performance on comparable hardware. Additional points raised include curiosity about how the system’s CPU and memory usage affect query speed, its relationship to DuckDB’s vector extensions, and the relevance of similarity searches for text classification tasks.

              The comments express overall appreciation for a concise, refreshing post and anticipation for future installments, while also highlighting several critiques of major platforms. Users note irony in Apple permitting phone‑antivirus apps despite its touted superiority and high developer fees, and they discuss growing difficulties with Instagram’s login walls and link access, including resistance to signing up. Additional remarks reference Facebook’s historical URL filtering and inject humor about iPhone viruses, reflecting a blend of praise, platform skepticism, and light‑hearted commentary.

            A 2001 Sun Netra X1 SPARC server (500 MHz UltraSPARC IIe, 1 GB ECC SDRAM, IDE disks) was repurposed to host a static website. The OS is OpenBSD 7.8, installed via PXE/TFTP/NFS because the machine lacks optical or USB boot. Only essential packages were added (git, vim, neofetch, htop, rsync); the built‑in OpenBSD httpd serves HTML/CSS from /var/www, with directory listings disabled and hidden files blocked. The system runs ~55 MB RAM, with sshd and httpd as the only network services. A Cloudflare tunnel provides outbound‑only connectivity: a modern host (e.g., Proxmox LXC) runs cloudflared, forwarding traffic to the Netra’s internal address (192.168.1.248:80). pf is configured with a default‑deny policy, allowing ssh from local subnets (192.168.1.0/24, 10.0.1.0/24) and HTTP only from the tunnel host (10.0.1.210). No dynamic content, CGI, or PHP is used, minimizing attack surface while demonstrating that legacy SPARC hardware can reliably serve static web pages when combined with contemporary tunneling and firewall techniques.

              Comments collectively recall the extensive use of Sun and SPARC hardware for web hosting during the late‑1990s and early‑2000s, emphasizing its durability and historical prevalence. Many note that such machines can still run simple sites, though they acknowledge limitations for higher traffic and consider the practice unremarkable today. Some criticize the framing of the topic as clickbait, while others express fatigue with repeated discussions of legacy hardware for hosting, suggesting modern solutions like cloud services are more appropriate. Overall sentiment blends nostalgia with practical skepticism.
