            Porsche AG delivered 279,449 vehicles in 2025, a 10 % decline from 310,718 in 2024, primarily due to supply gaps for 718 and Macan combustion models and weaker demand for premium products in China. The Macan remained the top‑selling line with 84,328 units (45,367 fully electric, 38,961 combustion), while the 911 sport‑car recorded a record 51,583 deliveries. Overall, 34.4 % of deliveries were electrified (22.2 % fully electric, 12.1 % plug‑in hybrid), meeting the 20‑22 % target for fully electric models. Europe saw an electrified‑vehicle share of 57.9 %, the first time exceeding combustion sales; one‑third of European deliveries were fully electric. Regional volumes: North America 86,229 (stable), Overseas and Emerging Markets 54,974 (‑1 %), Europe (ex‑Germany) 66,340 (‑13 %), Germany 29,968 (‑16 %), China 41,938 (‑26 %). The 718 line ended production in October 2025, and the fully electric Cayenne launched in late 2025 with deliveries beginning in spring 2026. Porsche’s 2026 strategy emphasizes “value over volume” and expanded customization programs.

              The comments convey a broadly negative view of German luxury automakers, noting recent sales declines, perceived reliability problems, and uninspired design, especially in newer electric models. There is consensus that Chinese manufacturers are gaining a competitive edge in EV technology and market share, while some express a shift toward Japanese or Chinese brands and reduced personal car use. Simultaneously, discussions acknowledge the appeal of EVs and hybrids but raise concerns about cost, debt, and the broader ecological implications of vehicle ownership.

              The comments express strong criticism of social‑media research and platform practices, emphasizing pervasive industry influence, undisclosed funding, and insufficient ethical oversight. Viewers link this pattern to other sectors such as tobacco, food, and fossil fuels, arguing that reliance on corporate data creates conflicts that undermine trust and policy relevance. A prevailing demand emerges for greater transparency, stricter disclosure standards, and independent research channels, while many convey resignation about the difficulty of escaping corporate‑driven narratives. Overall sentiment is markedly distrustful and alarmed.

              The discussion balances optimism about using LLMs as pseudocode‑to‑code translators with skepticism toward inventing new languages. It notes that LLM performance aligns with training‑data coverage, favoring established languages, yet experiments show an LLM can follow custom language specs when documentation is supplied. Concerns include the overhead of teaching niche syntax, Rust‑style error handling, and unclear design rationales. Suggestions emphasize a Lisp‑like, strongly‑typed syntax, support for streaming, multilingual use, and agentic tooling, while questioning the novelty compared to existing targets such as WebAssembly.

              The remarks convey strong enthusiasm for Reticulum’s recent 1.0.0 release, highlighting its ability to transmit photos and voice over LoRa and to fall back to alternative links when bandwidth is limited. Users express interest in experimenting with the protocol on devices such as the T‑Deck, noting its potential to operate on any platform capable of executing code and interfacing with another device, even via serial connections. There is also awareness of licensing constraints prohibiting use in AI training datasets.

            - On 2025‑12‑02 Cloudflare introduced a memory‑saving change that altered how CNAME records were merged into cached DNS answers, moving CNAMEs from the start of the answer section to the end.  
- The change was deployed to testing on 2025‑12‑10 and globally rolled out on 2026‑01‑07. By 2026‑01‑08 the reordered responses caused widespread resolution failures, prompting a rollback at 18:27 UTC and full restoration by 19:55 UTC.  
- Some DNS clients (e.g., glibc’s getaddrinfo and Cisco switch DNSC) parse answers sequentially and expect CNAME records before any A/AAAA records; when CNAMEs appear later, they discard the preceding A records, resulting in empty answers or reboot loops.  
- Most resolvers (e.g., systemd‑resolved) search the entire answer set, so they remain unaffected.  
- RFC 1034’s wording (“possibly preface”) is ambiguous; it does not mandate CNAME ordering, unlike later RFCs (e.g., 4035) which use normative “MUST” language for other record types.  
- Cloudflare reverted the change and is drafting an Internet‑Draft to clarify that CNAMEs should be placed before other answer records in DNS responses.

              The discussion focuses on the interpretation of RFC 1034 regarding CNAME ordering, asserting that the wording clearly requires CNAME records to precede other data and criticizing implementations that ignore this. Participants cite Cloudflare’s past apex‑CNAME feature, glibc’s resolver behavior, and various vendor bugs as evidence of widespread breakage caused by ambiguous specifications and insufficient testing. The consensus calls for stricter adherence to the original RFC, more comprehensive test suites, and cautious evolution of DNS standards to avoid further incompatibilities.

              The discussion highlights user concern over recent changes to Nova Launcher, noting that the app is now owned by a different company and that newer versions incorporate additional advertising and analytics components such as Facebook Ads, Google AdMob, Branch, Bugsnag, CrashLytics, and Firebase Analytics. Commenters point out that these additions bring extra permissions and tracking capabilities, which many view as a shift toward monetization and reduced privacy compared with earlier releases. The overall sentiment reflects unease about the expanded data collection and ad integration.

            The author built autonomous agents using Opus 4.5 and GPT‑5.2 to generate exploits for a zero‑day vulnerability in the QuickJS JavaScript interpreter, imposing modern mitigations (ASLR, non‑exec memory, RELRO, CFI, shadow‑stack, seccomp) and constraints (unknown heap, no hard‑coded offsets). The agents produced 40+ distinct exploits across six scenarios; GPT‑5.2 solved every scenario, Opus 4.5 missed two. Typical runs required ≤30 M tokens (≈ $30) and completed in under an hour; the hardest task needed ~50 M tokens (≈ $50) and three hours, involving a seven‑function call chain through glibc’s exit handler. The study argues that exploit development is becoming “industrialised”: task completion will be limited by token throughput rather than human expertise, provided an LLM can search solution spaces and autonomously verify results. Current limitations include QuickJS’s reduced complexity versus browsers and reliance on known mitigation gaps rather than novel breaks. The author calls for large‑scale, token‑heavy evaluations on real, complex targets (e.g., Linux kernel, Firefox) to better assess future automation of broader intrusion stages.

              The comments express mixed views on LLM‑generated exploits. While the demonstration of a complex payload suggests potential risk, many consider the threat limited and comparable to existing tools, noting that defenses such as CI red‑team testing and fuzz‑like pipelines could mitigate it. Opinions diverge on whether LLMs truly produce effective exploits or merely noisy reports, and there is broader concern that future attack capacity may depend more on token throughput than on human expertise. Skepticism remains about current LLM capabilities in reverse engineering and the plausibility of large‑scale AI‑driven hacking.

              The comments discuss historical poverty in Victorian London and draw parallels to modern challenges faced by disabled veterans in the United States, noting limited support despite medical advances. They critique the handling of a recently discovered veteran memoir, questioning the researcher’s decision to withhold broader access and suggesting a more open, possibly self‑published approach targeting Christian bookstores. Overall, the tone combines historical reflection, concern for veteran welfare, and skepticism toward proprietary control of rare historical material.

            Japan’s SaaS market requires a distinct go‑to‑market approach. Sales cycles are longer, with buyers preferring to download product documentation first, then conduct internal, consensus‑based evaluations before engaging vendors. Aggressive follow‑up is ineffective; relationship building and education are essential, leading to higher retention once a deal closes. Trust hinges on product and content localization (website, documentation, support) and strong social proof, especially case studies from Japanese or reputable foreign clients. Effective website design uses “Download Documents” as the primary CTA rather than “Book a Demo.” Companies should assess inbound traffic and existing Japanese leads before committing resources; low‑cost tests include localized landing pages and SEO research. Trade‑show participation can provide market insight but rarely yields immediate sales without Japanese‑speaking staff. Nihonium offers fractional Japan teams—handling sales, marketing, support, SEO, and event logistics—for SaaS firms with ARR roughly $5‑20 M that see demand but are not ready for a full subsidiary. Success demands dedicated budget, long‑term commitment, and localized collateral.

              The article is received positively, with appreciation for its insights. Across the discussion, there is strong agreement that succeeding with SaaS in Japan requires adapting to local payment preferences, providing comprehensive Japanese language support—including customer service—and embracing a relationship‑driven sales approach rather than pure self‑service. Networking and on‑the‑ground engagement are viewed as valuable for building connections and traction, and many consider establishing a local entity and hiring Japanese‑speaking staff important for closing enterprise contracts.
