              The comments express strong admiration for Feynman's volumes and lectures, highlighting their clear explanations, timeless relevance, and utility for both personal study and teaching. Readers appreciate the first‑principles approach and find the material inspiring beyond typical textbooks. Common critiques include the absence of problem sets, occasional gaps in derivations, and the unconventional organization that may require reordering for course use. Several mentions note specific talks on computation, the principle of least action, and nanotechnology as especially valuable.

            The post details a visit to a modern SMPTE 2110 broadcast truck (a 45 Flex from Mobile TV Group) used for St. Louis Blues NHL games. Key technical elements observed include two Evertz 5700 MSC‑IP “Root Leader” grandmaster clocks with a 5700 ACO changeover, costing $25‑30 k and providing Precise Time Protocol (PTP) synchronization per IEEE 1588 / SMPTE 2059‑2 for video, audio, and metadata. Timing is monitored with a Tektronix PRISM IP engineering test tool, and clocks are often set manually via an “Atomic Clock” smartphone app because mobile units lack reliable GPS reception. The truck’s network distributes PTP to the video switcher, cameras, and EVS XT‑VIA replay servers. Audio uses extensive analog XLR bundles, while video and data rely on hybrid fiber‑plus‑copper SMPTE connectors (3K.93C.Y) capable of 8 K signals over long runs. The venue’s patch bay houses hundreds of XLR, fiber, and SMPTE ports, with strict cleanliness to prevent “Layer 0” faults. The crew’s workflow emphasizes structured communication and seamless integration of timing and cabling infrastructure.

              The comment expresses appreciation for the article’s relevance to the industry and acknowledges the complexity of the SMPTE 2110 standard, noting that existing hardware often addresses it. It observes that PipeWire already provides decent AES67 support for network audio but lacks SMPTE 2110 video capabilities. The author wishes for broader support of compressed formats, suggesting that while uncompressed streams dominate, additional compression options—potentially including proprietary JPEG‑XS—could expand practical applications of network AV protocols.

            On 14 Jan 2026 at 21:00 UTC GreyNoise’s Global Observation Grid recorded a step‑function collapse in telnet traffic: hourly sessions fell from ~74 k to ~22 k, then to ~11 k, settling at ~373 k daily – a 59 % sustained reduction versus the pre‑drop baseline of ~914 k daily sessions (Dec 2025–Jan 14 2026). Eighteen ASNs that previously generated >50 k sessions each dropped to zero, notably Vultr (AS20473), Cox (AS22773), Charter/Spectrum (AS20115) and BT (AS2856). Five countries (Zimbabwe, Ukraine, Canada, Poland, Egypt) vanished from the telnet dataset. Major cloud providers were largely unaffected or increased (AWS +78 %). The pattern points to one or more North‑American Tier‑1 transit providers implementing TCP‑23 filtering during a US maintenance window, likely upstream of affected residential ISPs. Six days later CVE‑2026‑24061 (an unauthenticated root‑access bug in GNU Inetutils telnetd, CVSS 9.8) was disclosed; CISA added it to the KEV catalog on 26 Jan. GreyNoise hypothesizes advance notice of the vulnerability prompted the filtering, though causation cannot be proven. Recommendations: upgrade telnetd to 2.7‑2 or later, or disable telnet; federal KEV remediation deadline 16 Feb 2026.

              The comments reflect a mix of nostalgia for Telnet’s historic role and criticism of its insecure design, especially after the recent vulnerability in GNU telnetd. Many acknowledge that Telnet is largely obsolete for routine use, yet note its occasional utility for testing, legacy services, or hobbyist hacking. Concerns are raised about backbone providers blocking port 23, which some view as overreach while others see it as a reasonable security measure. Overall sentiment is that Telnet’s relevance has sharply declined, with security‑focused alternatives like SSH now preferred.

            The author discontinued a self‑hosted Git service that had been running publicly since 2011 (previously a CVS server). Increased traffic from AI scrapers overwhelmed the cgit web frontend, generating large numbers of useless requests and filling disk space with log data despite Apache handling the 404 responses. After fixing dangling links to point to mirrors on major git‑hosting platforms (GitLab, GitHub), the author retained only a self‑hosted web server for the blog and a few static sites, which were migrated to Jekyll in 2018. This static setup resists scraper overload, though a recent scraper‑induced outage still occurred due to rapid log growth; the issue was mitigated by adjusting logrotate configuration. The post marks the end of the author’s self‑hosted repository hosting.

              The discussion questions the attribution of recent web‑scraping activity to AI, suggesting the observed bots appear poorly engineered and more likely the work of conventional actors rather than sophisticated LLM‑driven tools. It notes that typical scraper behavior—high error rates and aggressive request patterns—remains unchanged, and asks for concrete logs or analyses to verify the AI claim. The comment also points out that standard mitigation services such as Cloudflare could effectively block the activity, implying the issue may be overstated.

              Comments show mixed reactions to the Rivian R2, with frequent criticism of its $45 k+ price and concerns that depreciation will be needed to reach affordable levels. Users repeatedly call for open V2G/V2H standards and integration with home‑battery systems, while many object to the touchscreen‑heavy interface, lack of CarPlay, and the replacement of physical buttons with haptic thumb‑wheels. Some appreciate the vehicle’s truck‑like capabilities and styling, yet others note its compact dimensions and compare it unfavorably to competitors, expressing a desire for stronger self‑driving technology and differentiation from Tesla.

            The author collects five AI‑progress metrics—MMLU scores, tokens‑per‑dollar (log‑scaled), frontier release intervals, arXiv “emergent” paper counts, and Copilot code share—and fits a separate hyperbolic curve \(y = k/(t_s\!-\!t)+c\) to each, sharing a common singularity time \(t_s\). Hyperbolic growth is argued to capture positive‑feedback acceleration, unlike exponential or polynomial models. Only the arXiv “emergent” series exhibits a clear R² peak at a finite \(t_s\); the other four fit linear trends and contribute no signal. The resulting singularity date is given with millisecond precision and a 95 % confidence interval derived from profile likelihood.  

The author interprets this pole not as a technical superintelligence breakthrough but as a “social singularity”: the point where human attention to AI accelerates beyond collective decision‑making capacity. Evidence cited includes rising AI‑related layoffs, delayed regulation, declining public trust (56 %), capital concentration in AI‑heavy S&P 500 stocks, therapist‑reported FOBO, low reproducibility, and emerging political realignment.  

Caveats note the reliance on a single metric, assumptions of stationarity, benchmark saturation, and limited data series, suggesting the date reflects a regime shift in hype rather than an imminent technical transformation.

              The discussion centers on the gap between technical progress and public perception of AI, emphasizing that belief in a forthcoming singularity drives funding and policy more than measurable capability growth, which many see as linear. Commenters express skepticism toward hype, worry about job displacement and societal strain, and note that AI advances are rooted in broader technological ecosystems rather than a sudden intelligence explosion. While some view AI’s trajectory as inevitable, others caution that overreliance may erode human expertise and that future breakthroughs may depend on new paradigms beyond current trends.

              Comments show a split between recognition of a genuine need for better observability and provenance of agent‑generated code and skepticism that the proposed solution adds real value beyond existing git‑based practices. Proponents highlight auditability, debugging across sessions, and the scarcity of tools that capture full reasoning, while critics point to storage overhead, adoption friction, redundant functionality, and the hype surrounding large funding rounds. Many cite similar open‑source attempts and suggest tighter integration with current workflows, concluding that the idea has merit but its necessity and market fit remain uncertain.

              Comments note that the malt framework presently lacks GPU support but development is ongoing, and some have successfully built small GPT models with it. Readers express enthusiasm for the book’s project‑based approach yet question its suitability for early learners, suggesting that introducing Scheme before Python or deep learning before calculus may be premature. Several contributors recommend a more traditional sequence—calculus fundamentals, Python plotting, then a concise deep‑learning text and PyTorch experiments—while acknowledging the book’s potential to reduce early frustration with programming.

            The page describes a series of modular “small boards” that each demonstrate a single electromechanical device from classic pinball machines. All boards share a common back‑panel wiring that supplies 24 V AC for relays/solenoids and 6 V AC for lamps; boards connect side‑by‑side and receive power from a single transformer. Each board includes an instruction card and video demo. Devices covered are:

- **Solenoid** – weak, slow‑moving plunger demonstration.  
- **Relays** – simple, interlocking, and stepper‑configured relays.  
- **Pop Bumper** – standard and slow‑motion versions using a microcontroller.  
- **Flipper** – standard and zipper flippers that can close to block a drain.  
- **Stepper Units** – non‑resetting stepper, Ball Count unit (forward‑only, reset), Credit unit (bidirectional, range‑limited), and Score Reels (mechanical odometer‑style counters).  
- **Projection Unit** – lamp, pinhole, lens system projecting credits onto a frosted surface.  
- **Spin Unit** – two‑stepper randomizer using a spinner to advance a secondary stepper.

Additional assemblies (score motor, chimes, ball lifters, magnets, disappearing post, various targets, captive ball unit, etc.) are referenced on subsequent pages. Patent links and detailed mechanical explanations are provided for each component.
