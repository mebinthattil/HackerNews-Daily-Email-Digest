              Comments show a mixed assessment of the Capital One‑Brex acquisition. Many note the steep drop from a $12 billion peak to a $5.15 billion sale, viewing it as favorable for early investors but harsh for late‑stage backers and employees whose equity is now underwater. Opinions diverge on the strategic outcome: some cite the deal as a realistic valuation reset and a boost from Brex’s growing revenue, while others criticize the failed AI pivot, competitive pressure from rivals, and Capital One’s credit‑reporting practices. Overall sentiment balances cautious optimism about the asset’s growth with concern over stakeholder impacts.

            GPTZero’s analysis of the NeurIPS 2025 accepted papers identified 100 instances of fabricated or inaccurate scholarly information. For each flagged entry, the tool compared the cited title, authors, venue, DOI, arXiv identifier, and publication year against existing records. The majority of “hallucinations” involved completely nonexistent papers, mismatched author lists, incorrect journal or conference details, and placeholder arXiv IDs (e.g., “arXiv:2401.XXXX”). Some citations partially matched real works—sharing a keyword or a single author—but differed in title, venue, or year, rendering them unreliable. In several cases, legitimate author names were paired with fabricated titles or vice‑versa, and DOI strings pointed to unrelated articles. The audit also uncovered repeated patterns of fabricated references across diverse domains (e.g., robotics simulators, uncertainty quantification, vision‑language adaptation, ocean nutrient modeling). Overall, GPTZero demonstrated that a substantial portion of the bibliographic metadata in the examined NeurIPS submissions could not be verified, highlighting pervasive citation hallucination.

              The comments express strong concern that AI‑generated hallucinated citations are slipping through peer review, undermining scientific credibility and amplifying existing incentives to prioritize publication volume over rigor. Repeated themes include criticism of insufficient verification tools, calls for automated citation checks, and demands for harsher penalties for undisclosed AI use. Some participants note the potential for the issue to highlight reproducibility problems and suggest reforms to review workloads and incentive structures, but overall the sentiment is wary and calls for stronger safeguards.

            SSH clients (e.g., macOS stock ssh) now add keystroke‑timing obfuscation: after each keypress they emit a burst of “chaff” packets (~20 ms apart) to mask typing speed. These packets are SSH2_MSG_PING messages sent when the server advertises the [email protected] extension. In a high‑performance game run over SSH, a single keystroke generated ~90 packets per second, 66 % of which were 36‑byte data packets, inflating CPU usage and bandwidth by ~50 %. Disabling the feature client‑side with ObscureKeystrokeTiming=no or server‑side by removing the [email protected] advertisement (by patching Go’s crypto/ssh library) stopped the chaff, cutting total CPU from 29.9 % to 11.6 % and halving bandwidth (≈6.5 Mbit/s → 3 Mbit/s). The investigation used tcpdump/tshark scripts, identified the packet pattern, and confirmed the cause via ssh ‑vvv logs. The author notes the usefulness of LLM assistance in debugging but stresses the need to maintain a patched library.

              Comments show broad interest in the recent SSH keystroke‑timing obfuscation patch, with many acknowledging its security purpose but questioning its performance impact for latency‑sensitive use cases such as games. Readers suggest upstreaming configurable options, using alternatives like telnet, or tuning TCP parameters to reduce packet overhead, while warning against disabling the feature in production. The write‑up is praised for clarity, yet some participants criticize reliance on language models for debugging and note occasional off‑topic frustrations about network latency and infrastructure decisions.

              Comments express strong frustration with Anthropic’s support and account‑banning practices, describing unresponsive help channels, opaque content‑filtering blocks, and perceived arbitrary violations of terms of service. Users note occasional appreciation for Claude’s capabilities but criticize the lack of clear explanations, inconsistent enforcement, and difficulty appealing decisions. Many discuss seeking alternatives such as other providers or self‑hosted, open‑source models to avoid vendor lock‑in, while also highlighting concerns about safety filters, token costs, and the need for transparent, reliable customer service.

            The article explains how to make C libraries feel native in Swift without modifying the original C code. By creating a module.map and using swift‑synthesize‑interface you can view the automatically generated Swift API, which initially mirrors C (global functions, prefixed names, unsafe pointers, and opaque‑pointer types). Swift‑specific annotations—applied either directly in the header or via a separate .apinotes YAML file—transform these mappings:

* enum_extensibility marks C enums as closed, producing Swift enums with cases and raw values.  
* SWIFT_SHARED_REFERENCE converts reference‑counted opaque pointers into Swift classes that manage retain/release automatically.  
* SWIFT_RETURNS_RETAINED indicates functions that return ownership, enabling Swift to balance releases.  
* SWIFT_NAME adds argument labels and can re‑export functions as methods on the appropriate Swift class.

Using the WebGPU header as an example, the process yields Swift‑style constructs such as WGPUInstance(descriptor:), instance.createSurface(descriptor:), and queue.writeBuffer(buffer:bufferOffset:data:size:), with automatic memory management and clearer syntax. The approach relies on Swift 6.2.3+ bug fixes and works for any well‑designed C library.

            The page “Bugs Apple Loves” presents a quantitative model for estimating the productivity loss caused by unresolved Apple software bugs. It defines four components:  

- **Base Impact** = Users Affected × Frequency × Time per Incident, measuring the direct time each affected user spends dealing with a bug.  
- **Power User Tax** = Σ (Workaround Time × Participation Rate), capturing additional effort from users who create or apply temporary fixes.  
- **Shame Multiplier** = Years Unfixed × Pressure Factor, scaling impact by the duration the bug has remained unresolved and its perceived urgency.  
- **Verdict** = Human Hours Wasted ÷ Engineering Hours to Fix, indicating how many times the wasted human labor exceeds the engineering effort required for a fix.  

The site invites readers to edit the underlying numbers, emphasizing that each bug’s parameters differ but the overall calculation remains real‑valued.

              The comments express mixed reactions, noting that the project still lacks key SQLite features such as savepoints, window functions, and database attachment, which raises doubts about its readiness. Some view a focus on unique capabilities—like supporting multiple writers or targeting OLAP scenarios—as more marketable than simply branding it as a SQLite successor. Praise is directed toward SQLite’s long‑standing impact and its creator, while interest is shown in the Rust‑based rewrite and its active development. Skepticism remains about its necessity and language‑specific suitability.

            The post critiques medieval city‑builder video games for deviating from historical settlement patterns. It notes that early titles such as *Sim City*, *Caesar*, and *Age of Empires* gave rise to medieval‑themed games like *Settlers* (1993) and *Knights and Merchants* (1998), which typically start with a central village and expand linearly through resource gathering and production chains. Historical research shows medieval villages were often stable in size, subject to subsistence limits, tithes, taxes, disease, warfare, and environmental risks, with growth occurring only under exceptional conditions. Archaeological evidence from West‑Brabant identifies three planned settlement types—circular manor (BORCH), linear street settlement, and hybrid exploitation village—each laid out by land surveys, water access, and defined field strips. Management involved crop rotation (three‑field system), pasture, road maintenance, and regular tax collection. The author suggests more accurate games would allow pre‑planned layouts, curved roads, flood mechanics, and explicit tithe/land‑owner interactions, but acknowledges gameplay, path‑finding, and market expectations often favor simplified, linear growth models.

              The comments highlight a prevailing tension between historical fidelity and gameplay enjoyment, with many players prioritizing immersive, satisfying mechanics over accurate medieval layouts or economic details. Several titles such as Banished, Manor Lords, and older Settlers games are cited as examples that balance realism and fun, while older RTS titles are noted for simplifying or omitting complex historical factors. Nostalgia for medieval builders is acknowledged, yet there is consensus that realistic constraints often hinder fun, leading designers to deliberately abstract or streamline historical elements.

              The comments express overall enthusiasm for the new TTS model’s quality, noting it often surpasses previous systems yet sometimes produces erratic or overly emotive output. Users discuss practical challenges such as running the model locally on non‑CUDA hardware, especially macOS, and seek clearer installation guidance. There is strong interest in applying the voice‑cloning feature to audiobooks, game dialogue, and restoration of old recordings, while comparing its performance to existing services like ElevenLabs and Parakeet. A minority voice concerns about the company’s leadership and political stance, but the dominant sentiment remains curiosity and optimism about experimenting with the technology.
