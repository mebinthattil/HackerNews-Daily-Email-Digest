            The post documents testing of macOS 26.3’s window‑resizing behavior using a custom app that scans the bottom‑right corner for mouse‑event zones. In the Release Candidate, Apple changed the resize regions to follow the window’s corner radius instead of remaining square. However, the vertical/horizontal resize band (yellow) narrowed: the inner portion reduced from 3 px to 2 px, and the overall band thickness dropped from 7 px to 6 px—a 14 % reduction that increases missed resize attempts. In the final macOS 26.3 release, this adjustment was removed, restoring the original square regions. Correspondingly, the release notes were updated, reclassifying the issue from “Resolved” to a “Known Issue.” The findings are illustrated with three comparative images.

              The comments express broad dissatisfaction with macOS window‑management, particularly the difficulty of resizing and moving windows due to thin borders, rounded corners, and inconsistent hit‑testing, which many view as a regression or design flaw. Users compare the experience unfavorably to Linux and Windows, cite workarounds such as third‑party tools, and request features like predefined zones and edge‑linked resizing. Technical critiques of the recent pixel‑size change appear, while some note similar bugs on multi‑monitor setups and lament perceived misallocation of engineering resources at Apple.

            Ring announced it is canceling the planned integration with surveillance‑technology firm Flock Safety after intense public backlash. In a blog statement the company said the integration would require more time and resources than expected, and that it never launched, so no Ring videos were sent to Flock. The decision follows criticism that the partnership could aid ICE and other federal agencies, amid broader concerns over Ring’s collaborations with law‑enforcement tools such as the “Community Requests” program, which replaced the controversial “Requests for Assistance” system. Community Requests still permits agencies that use third‑party evidence‑management platforms (now Axon and the cancelled Flock) to request user video during active investigations. Ring also faced scrutiny for its new AI‑driven “Search Party” and “Familiar Faces” facial‑recognition features, prompting a Senate letter urging Amazon to drop facial‑recognition. The Axon partnership remains unchanged, and Ring says no other integrations are being explored.

              The comments express strong criticism of the company’s surveillance partnership, viewing the cancellation as a reaction to public backlash rather than a genuine ethical shift and fearing a possible quiet reinstatement later. Many highlight concerns about data privacy, corporate influence, and law‑enforcement collaboration, while advocating for locally hosted, encrypted alternatives such as HomeKit or self‑run NVR solutions. Overall sentiment is distrustful of the brand’s motives, skeptical of the cancellation’s permanence, and supportive of privacy‑focused camera options.

            The article argues that coding‑assistant performance depends more on the harness—the interface that presents files, applies edits, and manages state—than on the underlying LLM. Existing agents use three main edit formats: OpenAI‑style `apply_patch` diffs, simple `str_replace` substitutions, and a dedicated cursor model (e.g., Aider). These formats often fail because they require exact token‑level reproduction of source text, leading to high patch‑failure rates (e.g., 50 % for Grok‑4, 46 % for GLM‑4.7).  

The author introduces “hashline”, a line‑level tagging scheme where each line receives a short content hash (e.g., `2:f1`). Edits reference these tags instead of raw text, allowing the harness to verify line identity before applying changes and eliminating dependence on whitespace or exact matches.

A benchmark generated 180 mutated React files per run, described in plain English, and evaluated 16 models with three edit tools. Results show hashline consistently outperforms patch and often beats replace; weaker models gain the most (e.g., Grok‑Code‑Fast 1 improves from 6.7 % to 68.3 %). Token usage drops up to 61 % due to fewer retries.  

The author notes vendor restrictions (Anthropic blocking OpenCode, Google disabling a Gemini account) hinder community‑driven harness improvements, emphasizing that open‑source harness engineering offers the highest‑leverage path to more reliable coding tools. All code and benchmark data are released under the “oh‑my‑pi” project.

              The discussion emphasizes that tooling and harness design are as crucial as model quality, with many participants citing concrete gains from better edit formats, structured diffs, and AST‑based tools. While some view reported improvements as modest or overstated, a majority agrees that engineering refinements can outweigh raw model advances and that open‑source, customizable harnesses are needed. Concerns are raised about token waste, platform bans, and benchmark inflation, yet overall sentiment is that focused harness work offers significant, under‑exploited efficiency and reliability benefits.
