              The comments express strong concern about the Notepad++ supply‑chain incident, focusing on unclear targeting criteria, the extent of compromise, and how users can verify whether their installations were affected. Many request concrete mitigation steps, signature verification, and details about the hosting provider, while drawing parallels to similar past attacks on other open‑source tools. Skepticism appears toward the limited information provided and toward political framing of the threat, with overall sentiment centered on caution and a desire for clearer technical guidance.

            The article describes reverse‑engineering a parallel‑port copy‑protection dongle used by a 1990s RPG II compiler (RPGC.EXE) and its associated tools (SEU.EXE) for an accounting package running on Windows 98/DOS. The dongle, marked “Software Security Inc.” and “RUNTIME”, is required by the compiler, which embeds the same protection routine into every compiled executable. Disassembly with Reko revealed a 0x90‑byte routine in segment 0800 that performs IN/OUT operations on the LPT1 port, accumulates responses in BH and BL, and returns a constant value in BX. Since the routine takes no input, the result is fixed; BH is hard‑coded to 0x76, leaving BL as the only variable. Brute‑forcing BL (0–255) via a script in DOSBox identified the correct value (0x06), making the magic number 0x7606. Patching the first four bytes of the routine to “MOV BX,7606h; RETF” bypasses the dongle check for all compiler executables, enabling compilation and execution of the legacy RPG software without hardware. The author plans to release the patched compiler as a historical artifact.

              The discussion reflects a nostalgic but pragmatic view of legacy hardware dongles, noting their simple design and the ease with which they were historically cracked, while recognizing that some users still prefer tangible protection over cloud‑based licensing. Commenters highlight the challenges of maintaining obsolete dongle‑dependent systems, the business incentive for perpetual licenses and vendor lock‑in, and concerns about legal risks of reverse‑engineering old software. Technical details about emulation and patching are shared, and there is general agreement that modern licensing has largely moved beyond such rudimentary mechanisms.

              The comments express strong caution about the project’s security implications, emphasizing fear that granting an AI extensive permissions could enable malicious actions and that current safeguards appear insufficient. Many criticize AI‑generated documentation as off‑putting and call for clearer, human‑written readmes and explicit disclaimers. Positive notes mention the novelty of using Apple containers for minimal footprint and appreciation for the concept’s potential, yet overall sentiment remains wary, urging tighter sandboxing, better transparency, and careful risk assessment before adoption.

              The discussion stresses that retaining the original title, which highlights the actor model’s relevance to distributed systems, is important because the phrase “in distributed systems” distinguishes its proper context. Commenters argue that applying the actor model—or similar approaches like CSP—to single‑process code often leads to unnecessary, unstructured concurrency, and they recommend structured concurrency for such cases. References to related literature, the original author, and the Pony language are provided to support the focus on distributed‑system applications.

            Xikipedia is a prototype social‑media feed that presents content sourced from Simple Wikipedia. It uses a basic, non‑machine‑learning algorithm that runs locally in the browser to infer a user’s interests from their interactions and then recommends similar articles. No user data is transmitted, stored, or shared; all processing occurs client‑side and data is cleared when the page is refreshed or closed. The project’s source code is publicly available on GitHub, with discussion channels on federated platforms such as fedi, Bluesky, and Twitter. Users may select predefined categories or add custom ones to seed the feed. Because the underlying articles are drawn randomly, the interface can display adult‑oriented (NSFW) material, and users are warned to proceed only if they are of legal age.

            The Apple 1 is a single‑board microcomputer built around a MOS Technology 6502 CPU and includes an integrated video terminal and sockets for 8 KB of dynamic RAM. It ships fully assembled, tested, and with an onboard power supply for immediate use; the listed price is $666.66 (including the 4 KB RAM version). The video terminal connects to a monitor or TV (via an RF modulator) and displays 960 characters (40 × 24) with automatic scrolling, using a dedicated 1 KB video memory so all main RAM remains available to programs. A keyboard interface accepts standard ASCII keyboards, eliminating the need for a teletype. Memory uses sixteen 4‑pin 4 KB DRAM chips, occupying one quarter the space and power of earlier 2102 parts; the system is expandable to 65 KB through an edge connector and can be upgraded to 16‑KB chips for 32 KB onboard RAM. An attached cassette board provides 1 500 bps data transfer, allowing 4 KB to be read or written in roughly 20 seconds and works with generic audio cassette recorders. Software supplied includes Apple BASIC on tape, a disassembler, and several games, with additional tools such as a macro assembler under development. The product is marketed as readily available in major computer stores.

              The comments blend nostalgia for Apple’s early hardware and its original philosophy of low‑cost software with criticism of today’s restrictive policies. Contributors note that running macOS in a virtual machine can be licensable if the hardware is Apple‑derived, while many developers express frustration over long notarization times, EU App Store limitations, and compliance hurdles that clash with industry norms. Historical ads and anecdotes are cited to illustrate Apple’s evolution from hobbyist‑focused, affordable products to a premium, subscription‑driven model, highlighting both admiration for past engineering and disappointment with current practices.

            The HS2 railway construction has uncovered a diverse collection of archaeological artefacts now held in a secure warehouse. Items documented include:

- Roman material: a detailed coin, a pottery head fragment, and a bone tag associated with gladiators.  
- Medieval and post‑medieval objects: a 13th‑14th century gold “three‑lions” pendant, a bone‑carved cubic die, 19th‑century gold dentures, and a glazed porcelain figurine of a pug.  
- Anglo‑Saxon and earlier finds: a decorated bone spindle whorl, an Anglo‑Saxon spinning whorl, and a Paleolithic hand axe.  
- Imported pieces: a French pipe likely made by Fiolet of St Omer.  

These discoveries were recorded along the HS2 corridor from London to Birmingham, with a mapped sequence of sites spanning Roman, Anglo‑Saxon, medieval, and modern periods. Critics of the project, citing cost overruns, delays, and environmental impacts, argue that the cultural and historic value of such finds does not justify continued construction.

              The discussion touches on the current HS2 route, noting that tracking it can be challenging for casual observers. It highlights a perspective that infrastructure projects can yield unexpected archaeological benefits, such as uncovering ancient tools and 19th‑century gold dentures, while simultaneously critiquing strong local opposition in Britain. The tone mixes factual observation with humor, acknowledging both the logistical complexities of the rail line and the cultural value of the discoveries it has prompted. Overall, the sentiment balances appreciation for the project's side benefits against frustration with NIMBY resistance.

          <div class="summary-content">
            The article presents a method for creating Time‑Machine‑style incremental backups with rsync. A shell script generates a timestamp (`date "+%Y-%m-%dT%H-%M-%S"`), defines `USER`, `SOURCEDIR`, and `TARGETDIR`, then runs:

```
rsync -avPh --delete --link-dest=$TARGETDIR/current \
      $SOURCEDIR/$USER/ $TARGETDIR/$USER-$TIMESTAMP \
      > /var/log/rsync/$TIMESTAMP.log 2>&1
```

If rsync exits successfully, the script replaces the `current` symlink with the new snapshot (`ln -s $TARGETDIR/$USER-$TIMESTAMP $TARGETDIR/current`); on failure it renames the incomplete directory to `failed‑$USER‑$TIMESTAMP`. The `--link-dest` option creates hard links to unchanged files, so each snapshot stores only new or modified data, conserving space. A cron entry runs the script daily at 5 AM. The author notes that before deleting old snapshots a fresh full backup should be taken, and credits Mike Rubel for influencing the solution.

              The discussion emphasizes backup strategies, noting that while hard‑link based scripts are simple and appealing, many users now favor more robust solutions such as Borg, restic, or kopia for reliable backups, and Syncthing for mirroring. References to earlier implementations and tools like rsnapshot illustrate the evolution of the approach. There is interest in macOS‑specific automation using launchd and FSEvents, and some suggest replacing hard‑link methods with direct rsync copies or Syncthing transfers for external or remote storage.

            Adventure Game Studio features “Nothmere,” a game released 31 January 2026. The opening scenario places the player alone on a cold, rocky shore under a moonless sky, having been dragged from the sea through a sewer pipe with no memory of identity or circumstances. The site includes visual assets such as the Adventure Game Studio logo, a “Brainrot!” image, a “Nothmere” screenshot, artwork for “King’s Quest II+ VGA,” a “Whispers of a Machine” illustration, an award‑winner placeholder, and another Adventure Game Studio logo. The content provides minimal narrative detail, focusing on the game’s atmospheric premise and associated imagery.

              The discussion centers on nostalgia for classic adventure‑game construction tools and appreciation that Adventure Game Studio remains active and open‑source. Contributors recall personal experiences with early software, note its continued development, community projects, and compatibility extensions such as ScummVM. Several comments express desire for macOS support and cross‑platform availability, while others mention alternative engines and personal projects. Overall sentiment is positive toward AGS’s longevity and usefulness, with occasional frustration about platform limitations.

            The author discovered that an iPhone 16 Pro Max (A18 chip) produced nonsensical output when running MLX‑based large language models, while the same code worked on an iPhone 15 Pro, a MacBook Pro, and later on an iPhone 17 Pro Max. Debugging involved logging tensor values during inference with a quantized Gemma model on the prompt “What is 2+2?”. Initial layers produced identical inputs on both devices, but later tensors on the iPhone 16 differed by orders of magnitude, leading to incorrect generation. The discrepancy was traced to the Neural Engine’s Metal‑accelerated tensor computations, suggesting a hardware defect in that specific device rather than a software issue. The author concluded that the phone should be returned to Apple, noting that similar Apple Intelligence download problems reported by other users may share the same hardware cause. The episode highlighted the importance of considering physical hardware failures when debugging ML workloads on mobile devices.

              The comments express frustration with an apparent numerical‑calculation bug on recent iPhone models, questioning the reliability of Apple’s low‑level APIs and the usefulness of large language models for simple arithmetic. Contributors call for reproducible testing on multiple devices, more thorough debugging, and formal reporting to Apple, while also noting that dedicated calculator tools or emulators often perform better. Several remarks critique the perceived overvaluation of Apple products and suggest practical work‑arounds, reflecting a generally skeptical and demanding attitude toward the issue.
