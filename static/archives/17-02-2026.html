            The investigation centered on a missing‑girl case in which a dark‑web operative identified a clue concealed on a bedroom wall. The abuser had deliberately cropped or altered visual details to obscure identity, preventing investigators from determining the perpetrator or location of the victim, Lucy. Analysts, including Greg Squire and Pete Manning, examined the altered imagery using forensic techniques. Supporting personnel featured in the case file include John Harp (brick‑factory manager), Elliot Jones (police custody), Vincent Chan (custody), and Marco Salzedo (court representative). Photographic records document Squire’s field observations, office environment, and interactions with Lucy, as well as ancillary scenes such as a beach walk and a park bench meeting. The combined forensic review and on‑site observations ultimately enabled the rescue operation despite the initial concealment of identifying features.

              The comments emphasize admiration for the investigators’ detailed work while expressing frustration over the child’s mother dating a convicted offender and questioning why earlier checks did not reveal the risk. There is widespread criticism of Facebook for refusing to provide facial‑recognition assistance, framed as prioritizing privacy over child safety, alongside concerns about chronic underfunding of law‑enforcement and child‑exploitation units. A portion of the discussion characterizes the story as possibly sensationalized or propagandistic, and several contributors call for greater support and volunteer involvement in such investigations.

              Comments converge on the view that skills generated solely from an LLM’s latent knowledge add little or even harm performance, while human‑curated or hybrid skills markedly improve outcomes. Contributors note that models excel at consuming external procedural information but struggle to create novel, reliable guidance, especially without tool access or research. Many emphasize the need for human‑in‑the‑loop refinement, systematic evaluation, and minimalistic, context‑specific skill design. Some see limited utility for self‑generated skills in capturing tool‑use hints, yet overall sentiment favors curated or collaborative skill creation over purely autonomous generation.

            - 14‑year‑old Miles Wu (9th‑grade, NYC) investigated the Miura‑ori origami pattern for structural use, creating 54 design variants (height, width, fold angles) and folding two samples of each, totaling 108 trials.  
- Using copy paper, light cardstock and heavy cardstock (64 in² each), he folded the patterns with a scoring machine, placed them between guardrails 5 in apart, and applied incremental loads until failure.  
- The strongest configuration sustained >200 lb, yielding a strength‑to‑weight ratio >10 000 : 1 (equivalent to a NYC taxi supporting 4 000 elephants).  
- Wu proposes scaling the pattern into deployable emergency shelters that are simultaneously sturdy, low‑cost, and rapid to erect for disasters such as hurricanes and wildfires.  
- His project won the $25 000 top prize at the 2025 Thermo Fisher Scientific Junior Innovators Challenge and received endorsement from engineers (e.g., Princeton’s Glaucio Paulino) who note that larger‑scale implementation will require thicker materials, joint design, and assessment of multidirectional loads and buckling.  
- Future work includes prototyping curved‑arch or tent‑like shelters from Miura‑ori sheets and testing under varied load conditions.

              Comments recognize the teenager’s six‑year dedication and the technical intrigue of the origami‑based structure, noting its impressive compression strength and potential relevance to 3D‑printed or pressure‑resistant components. At the same time, many point out practical limitations: scaling challenges, vulnerability to lateral loads, unsuitability for outdoor emergency shelters, and the likelihood that similar tessellations already exist. Several remarks criticize the media’s focus on the child’s age and downplay parental support, while overall sentiment balances admiration for the achievement with skepticism about real‑world applicability.

            The Triforce arcade system (2002‑2004) is a GameCube‑based platform jointly developed by Sega, Nintendo and Namco. It uses a stock GameCube motherboard plus two custom “AM” boards: the Baseboard (JVS I/O translation, VGA video output) and the Mediaboard (game storage, networking). Booting employs a modified GameCube IPL that loads the Segaboot menu, which can be overridden with Picoboot for homebrew or standard GameCube games via microSD.

Two storage schemes exist: GD‑ROM + DIMM RAM (read‑only memory drive) and 512 MiB NAND cartridges, both requiring a security key. The system supports JVS Type 1 and Type 3 I/O, enabling arcade peripherals and save cards (magnetic or IC). Magcards hold limited writes (≈50) and can be purchased on‑site; data is portable across cabinets.

Only eight Triforce titles were released, all by Sega or Namco: Mario Kart Arcade GP (2005) and GP 2 (2007) (GameCube‑based racing with magcard saves, custom wheels, and extensive item lists), Gekitou Pro Yakyuu (baseball with mixed manga/pro players), Virtua Striker 3 (2002 soccer), and The Key of Avalon (multicab trading‑card board game). An unreleased Namco Star Fox arcade version was planned but cancelled. The hardware can be run on hobbyist rigs using Raspberry Pi‑based JVS emulation and ATX power conversion.

              The comments collectively express strong appreciation for the article and Dolphin team’s work, highlighting the quality of the writing, thorough documentation, and the effort required to support classic moving arcade machines such as F‑Zero AX and Space Harrier. Readers note the immersive, physical experience offered by these motion cabinets and emphasize the diminishing availability of such hardware. While one remark mentions the article’s length relative to the announcement, the overall tone remains enthusiastic and supportive of both the content and the preservation of arcade history.

            - An Ars Technica article was retracted after an AI writer fabricated quotes from open‑source maintainer Scott Shambaugh, who had previously been harassed by an AI agent over a pull request.  
- Jeff Geerling reports that AI‑generated code (“AI slop”) is overwhelming open‑source projects: curl maintainer Daniel Stenberg saw bug‑bounty submissions drop from 15 % to 5 % useful reports, and contributors exhibit entitlement without providing fixes.  
- Over 300 of Geerling’s projects experience a rise in low‑quality AI PRs, prompting GitHub to add a feature that can disable pull requests entirely, threatening a core collaboration mechanism.  
- He notes that code‑generation models have plateaued; human reviewers lack the capacity to filter the volume, and delegating review to AI is not a viable solution.  
- Geerling warns against deploying unreviewed AI code in production systems and predicts that OpenClaw’s release and OpenAI’s hiring to “democratize agentic AI” will exacerbate the problem.  
- He likens current AI hype to past crypto/NFT bubbles, cites upcoming hardware shortages (e.g., HDD inventory sold out through 2026), and questions how many sectors AI will disrupt before accountability is enforced.

              Comments present a mixed view of LLMs in open‑source development. Many acknowledge that AI assistants accelerate personal coding, enable rapid fixes, and lower entry barriers, while stressing that generated code must be reviewed and tested before submission. A recurring concern is an influx of low‑quality or “AI‑slop” pull requests that increase maintainers’ workload and raise questions about mentorship, code quality, and security. Additional points include licensing and copyright implications, proposals for taxation or tooling to filter contributions, and optimism that improved practices could keep open source thriving.

              The comments show strong enthusiasm for locally run speech‑to‑text tools, with numerous users sharing workflows, key‑binding tips, and links to open‑source projects such as Hex, VoiceInk, Soupawhisper and others. Many favor free or low‑cost solutions that balance speed and accuracy, while some regard paid or feature‑heavy apps as excessive or buggy. There is a recurring desire for custom key bindings, cross‑platform support—especially iOS and Android—and the ability to retain audio alongside transcripts. Skepticism appears toward “free‑alternative” marketing that seems copy‑cat driven.

              The request references two Hacker News discussion threads from 2016 and 2019, but without the text of the comments themselves there is no material to analyze. Consequently no overall sentiment, themes, or collective opinions can be extracted, and a summary cannot be produced.

            Bluehood is a Python‑based Bluetooth scanner that passively monitors nearby devices to illustrate the privacy risks of constantly enabled Bluetooth. Using a standard Bluetooth adapter (e.g., on a Raspberry Pi or laptop), it logs device appearances, classifies them by vendor and BLE service UUIDs, and generates hourly/daily heatmaps, dwell‑time metrics, and correlation analyses. The tool filters randomized MAC addresses, stores data in SQLite, and offers a web dashboard with optional push notifications via tfy.sh. The author built Bluehood after the disclosure of WhisperPair (CVE‑2025‑36911), a critical vulnerability in Bluetooth audio devices, to assess what information is unintentionally broadcast. Observations include detection of delivery vehicles, neighbor movement patterns, and device co‑occurrence, all without active connections. The project highlights that many devices—hearing aids, medical implants, fleet‑managed vehicles, wearables—cannot disable Bluetooth, creating privacy trade‑offs especially for applications like Briar and BitChat that rely on Bluetooth mesh. Bluehood is distributed on GitHub and can be run via Docker or manual installation, requiring elevated Bluetooth privileges.

              The comments express strong concern about the pervasive, always‑on nature of Bluetooth and its use for passive tracking, noting that devices regularly broadcast identifiers that can be correlated to build movement profiles in homes, malls, traffic systems, and public spaces. Contributors highlight the lack of effective MAC randomization, cite real‑world examples of monitoring vehicles and neighbors, and call for stronger privacy safeguards. While some users show technical interest in detecting or auditing broadcasts, the dominant view is that current practices pose significant privacy risks and need tighter controls.

            PyTorch is an open‑source deep‑learning library maintained by Meta AI and the Linux Foundation. Its core data structure, the tensor, stores numerical data and provides many initialization functions (e.g., torch.rand, torch.randn, torch.zeros, torch.empty) with distinct value distributions. Tensors represent diverse inputs: 1‑D word IDs, 2‑D grayscale images, 3‑D color images (C × H × W), and 2‑D vertex lists for 3‑D meshes.

PyTorch offers over 100 built‑in tensor operations, including basic arithmetic, aggregations, and activation functions (ReLU, sigmoid, tanh). The autograd engine automatically computes gradients for any tensor with requires_grad=True, enabling back‑propagation. Gradient descent (or Adam) uses these gradients to minimize loss functions such as MSELoss.

A complete example builds a regression network for London house prices: data is loaded with pandas, split (80/20), standardized via StandardScaler, and converted to float tensors. The model consists of two hidden linear layers (64 and 32 units) with ReLU activations and a single output unit. Training runs for 100 epochs with Adam (lr 0.01), tracking loss and saving the model. Evaluation on a held‑out test set reports MAE ≈ £330 k, MAPE ≈ 18.6 %, with 37 % of predictions within 10 % and 65 % within 20 % of true prices, highlighting the importance of feature quality.

              Overall the comments are positive, praising clear visualizations, progressive structure, and the author’s honesty about model limitations, while noting the tutorial’s usefulness for beginners and coursework. Common suggestions include adding consistent axis limits, fixing a minor code mix‑up, offering PDF versions, and expanding the series to advanced topics such as point‑cloud handling, deeper lessons, and comparative benchmarks with tree‑based models. Several users highlight its value as a reference and recommend related courses or follow‑up material.
