            TSMC announced a 36% revenue increase to $122 billion, driven by a 48% jump in high‑performance computing (HPC) sales and a 62% rise in Nvidia’s FY 2025 sales, while Apple’s product revenue is projected to grow only 3.6% for the year to Dec 2025. According to Culpium data, Nvidia may have overtaken Apple as TSMC’s largest client in one or two quarters of 2025, and could surpass Apple permanently in 2026. The AI boom is expanding demand for leading‑edge GPU wafers, forcing Apple to compete for fab capacity that once was guaranteed. TSMC’s 2026 capex is expected to reach $52‑56 billion, supporting volume production at its 2 nm (N2) node and upcoming N2P and A16 variants, with A14 slated for 2028. Margin pressure remains low; Q4 gross margin hit 62.3%, higher than if overseas fabs were excluded. Compared with Nvidia and Alphabet, TSMC’s capital intensity (≈33% of revenue) and depreciation (≈45% of cost of revenue) are substantially greater, reflecting its heavy fab investment risk as AI demand may eventually plateau.

              The comments converge on concerns that Apple’s reliance on TSMC and Nvidia’s willingness to pay premium fab prices create supply‑chain vulnerability, especially amid AI‑driven demand and geopolitical risks involving Taiwan. Many express skepticism about the high cost of hardware and perceived monopoly power, urging more diversified or in‑house manufacturing, such as Intel or potential Apple fabs. While some note Apple’s financial capacity to secure capacity, overall sentiment is critical of the current market dynamics, wary of pricing pressure on consumers, and doubtful about long‑term stability without broader fab competition.

            Shellbox provides on‑demand Linux virtual machines accessible solely via SSH. Each instance includes 2 vCPUs, 4 GB RAM and a 50 GB SSD, with a public HTTPS URL and automatic TLS termination. Boxes retain state by pausing on disconnect and resume on reconnection; they stop automatically when the account balance falls below $5. Billing is usage‑based at $0.05 per hour while running and $0.005 per hour while stopped, with prepaid balances, refunds for unused funds, and cost‑control limits. Core CLI commands include `create <name>` to provision a box, `connect <name>` to SSH in, `list` to view status and URLs, `billing` for balance and usage details, and `funds <amount>` to add credit. File transfer works via standard `scp`. The service requires no special client or browser plugins, and each box receives a unique public URL.

            Briar is an open‑source, peer‑to‑peer messaging application designed for secure, private communication without reliance on centralized servers. It establishes encrypted connections directly between devices or via Tor onion routing, providing anonymity and resistance to censorship. Because Google Play policies block its distribution, Briar is offered through alternative channels such as F‑Droid and direct APK downloads; users must enable “unknown sources” to install.  

Key points:
- Uses end‑to‑end encryption and onion services for all messages, files, and status updates.  
- Operates even without Internet access by forming local Bluetooth or Wi‑Fi direct links.  
- Requires Tor for initial network discovery; if Tor is unavailable, fallback direct connections are used.  
- The app size is about 48 MB; updates are delivered via the same distribution methods.  

Troubleshooting notes mention that installation may fail on Google Play, and users should verify the source and permissions. The “briar://” URI scheme allows sharing of contacts and groups. Overall, Briar provides decentralized, encrypted messaging suitable for environments with limited or monitored connectivity.

              Comments emphasize that loneliness is a widespread issue amplified by modern mobility, car‑centric neighborhoods, and pervasive digital distractions. Many suggest proactive personal steps such as regularly initiating meet‑ups, joining volunteer, religious, or hobby‑based groups, and treating friendships like a garden that requires consistent effort. Several contributors argue that individual actions are limited without broader societal incentives or structural changes to encourage community interaction. A recurring view notes rejection sensitivity and past trauma hinder social engagement, while others express skepticism about any lasting solution.

            The author lists several perceived shortcomings of Prolog while preparing a book chapter on Answer Set Programming and Logic Constraint Programming. Key issues include: lack of a standardized string type—implementations use atoms, character lists, or custom operators, causing incompatibility; absence of functions, forcing separate predicates and arithmetic expressions (e.g., length/2) and hindering concise expressions; limited built‑in collection types, restricted to lists and compound terms with no native maps or structs; true/false not being values but control‑flow constructs, making boolean handling cumbersome; cuts (!) and negation‑as‑failure (\+) being opaque and error‑prone, especially when used for conditionals or existential quantification; difficulty obtaining all query results without manual backtracking, requiring constructs like bagof/3 with existential quantifiers; ad‑hoc symbolic term conventions (e.g., ^, -) lacking formal definition; and sort/2 returning a set (removing duplicates) instead of a stable list, necessitating extra steps such as keysort/2. The author notes that alternative languages (Picat, ASP) address many of these concerns.

              The comments express a mixed view of Prolog, combining frustration with its perceived quirks and appreciation for its concepts. Critics argue that the language’s control constructs, such as cut and negation, are often misunderstood and can seem unintuitive, especially to newcomers, while acknowledging that these features serve specific purposes. The learning curve and unconventional syntax are cited as obstacles, yet bidirectional reasoning and logical expressiveness generate interest. Suggestions include integrating Prolog‑like capabilities into more familiar languages and exploring alternatives like Picat, reflecting both disappointment and curiosity.

              The discussion notes a surprisingly active Windows XP ecosystem, highlighting continued development of security updates, browsers, and third‑party clients. It points out that modern toolchains such as w64devkit can produce recent GCC builds for XP, and mentions projects like a .NET 10 starter targeting the platform. The author questions the difficulty of creating new software for XP and whether such nostalgia‑driven efforts have practical value, expressing curiosity about current feasibility and usefulness.

              Comments emphasize that competitive advantage stems from a mix of factors—vertical and horizontal integration, brand reputation, visible storytelling, design simplicity, network effects, regulatory positioning, and execution speed—rather than data alone. Attention is highlighted as the primary moat, with data serving mainly to capture that attention. Opinions are split between optimism about LLM progress and calls for critical evaluation of their limitations. Concerns about aggressive tactics, data ownership, and the need for regulation appear alongside recognition that algorithmic breakthroughs and user‑centric design can foster strong loyalty.
