            The author argues that current “agentic” coding tools—LLM‑driven chat assistants that generate code—do not improve productivity and often disrupt developers’ flow. Evidence includes personal experience, interview observations where candidates using such tools performed worse, and academic studies (e.g., Becker, Shen) showing no productivity gain and increased idle time. The author proposes applying **calm‑technology** principles—minimizing attention demands, being “pass‑through,” and fostering a calm state—to AI‑assisted development. Existing calm examples are IDE inlay hints and file‑tree previews, which unobtrusively augment information. In contrast, chat agents require active interaction, are indirect, and break flow. GitHub Copilot’s inline suggestions violate calm principles by demanding attention, whereas its “next edit” suggestions better preserve flow by being peripheral and bite‑sized. The author sketches future calm‑oriented tools: a facet‑based project navigator for semantic browsing, automated commit‑refactoring that splits changes into review‑friendly units, and a “file lens” offering focus‑on or edit‑as modes to filter or reinterpret code. The overall aim is to embed AI in developers’ workflows without relying on chat interfaces.

              The feedback acknowledges that the article’s title is misleading but finds the main content solid and sees potential for Agentic/AI coding to develop along the described trajectory. It characterizes current tools as early‑stage, likening them to the MS‑DOS era, and suggests they may later enable automatic translation from a developer’s preferred language to a target language. However, it doubts the practicality of agentic coding in interview settings, noting the need for precise, iteratively refined specifications and that outcomes depend heavily on prompt quality.

            SectorC is a 512‑byte x86‑16 boot‑sector C compiler that fits within a single boot sector. Written entirely in assembly, it supports a substantial C subset (global variables, functions, if/while, pointer dereference, inline asm, comments, and a range of operators) sufficient for real programs such as a VGA sine‑wave animation. The author describes the difficulty of implementing a lexer in 512 bytes and introduces “Barely C”, a space‑delimited C variant where tokens are treated as Forth‑style words; integer literals are processed with `atoi`, effectively acting as a 16‑bit hash to map identifiers to memory locations. The final implementation shrank from 468 bytes to 303 bytes through fall‑through code, tail‑calls, `stosw`/`lodsw` usage, and compact operator tables (4 bytes per operator). A minimal runtime supplies library routines and a startup entry point. The project includes example programs (hello screen, moving sine wave, PC‑speaker music) and a full grammar specification, demonstrating that a functional C compiler can reside entirely in a boot sector.

              The comments express strong enthusiasm for the minimalist 16‑bit boot‑sector C compiler, highlighting its nostalgic appeal, clever token‑hashing design, and the satisfaction of creating compact, low‑level code. Many appreciate its K&R‑style simplicity and compare it favorably to larger, AI‑generated compilers, while noting the lack of full C features such as structs and questioning the “C compiler” label. Overall sentiment is positive, recognizing both the technical elegance and the constraints of the minimal approach.

            Fast mode toggles a higher‑speed Opus 4.6 model in Claude Code (CLI, VS Code extension, and Console). Activation is via the /fast command or setting `"fastMode": true` in user settings, prompting a “Fast mode ON” message and a ↯ icon. Pricing begins at $30 per 150 MTok, with a 50 % discount on all plans until Feb 16 23:59 PT; usage is billed as extra usage and does not count against plan limits. Fast mode is available to Pro, Max, Team, and Enterprise subscribers but not on third‑party clouds (Amazon Bedrock, Google Vertex AI, Microsoft Azure Foundry). Teams/Enterprise require admin enablement; otherwise the command returns “Fast mode has been disabled by your organization.” The mode auto‑fallbacks to standard Opus 4.6 when rate‑limited, indicated by a gray ↯ icon, and resumes once cooldown ends. Recommended use cases include rapid code iteration, live debugging, time‑critical tasks, batch processing, and cost‑sensitive workloads. Availability, pricing, and API settings are subject to change as the feature remains in research preview.

              The comments focus on Anthropic’s new fast mode, noting its significant speed increase but a steep price multiplier compared with competitors. Users express mixed reactions: many see the higher cost as prohibitive and fear it could become a default that slows regular service, while a few consider speed essential for deadline‑driven coding tasks. Requests for a cheaper “slow mode” and clarification of token pricing are common, and speculation about hardware upgrades or partnership effects is widespread. Overall sentiment leans toward skepticism about value and pricing fairness.

            StrongDM’s “Software Factory” implements non‑interactive development: specifications and high‑level scenarios drive autonomous agents that generate code, execute harnesses, and converge without human authoring or review. The initiative began in July 2025 after Claude 3.5’s October 2024 update demonstrated long‑horizon coding correctness, especially via Anthropic’s YOLO mode, which reduced accumulated errors (syntax, library mismatches, hallucinations). Early experiments showed agents could pass narrow unit tests but required broader validation; the team introduced “scenarios”—end‑to‑end user stories stored outside the codebase—and measured “satisfaction” as the probabilistic fraction of scenario trajectories that meet user intent. Traditional tests were deemed too rigid and susceptible to reward hacking, prompting the creation of a Digital Twin Universe (DTU) that faithfully emulates APIs and edge cases of services such as Okta, Jira, Slack, Google Docs, Drive, and Sheets. DTU enables high‑volume, safe scenario testing, including failure modes, without live‑service limits or costs. The approach reshapes software economics by making high‑fidelity SaaS clones economically viable, encouraging a “deliberate naivete” that discards legacy constraints.

              The comments convey a mixed but largely cautious view of AI‑driven software factories. Many participants question the practicality of fully autonomous code generation, emphasizing the high token costs, the persistence of messy or incomplete output, and the necessity of human validation, testing, and security review. Skepticism is expressed toward bold productivity claims and the lack of rigorous quantitative evidence, while a minority note promising use cases such as digital‑twin simulations and automated integration scaffolding. Overall, the discussion balances intrigue about agentic workflows with concerns about quality, cost, regulatory implications, and the enduring role of engineers.

              The comment recounts extensive hands‑on work in a collider control room, highlighting the high operational costs, constant monitoring, and reliance on shared software tools, while noting the transition from RHIC to the upcoming eRHIC project. It observes staff turnover that may have been influenced by broader political factors and expresses a lay perspective questioning the tangible industrial applications of collider research, suggesting that advanced analysis, possibly via artificial intelligence, could enhance data exploitation. The overall tone is reflective and cautiously critical about resource use and future direction.

              The comments convey a broadly skeptical stance toward the proposed changes, emphasizing concerns that the initiative could become politicized and controlled by gatekeepers. There is a preference for native GitHub integration rather than external solutions, and apprehension that large language models may accelerate a shift toward an AI‑dominated environment. Additionally, many express unease that lowering entry barriers could degrade open‑source quality, leading to an influx of low‑quality, poorly maintained projects and eroding trust in the ecosystem.

              The discussion highlights mixed reactions to a face‑rating tool that assigns scores based on similarity to an algorithm‑defined “ideal” face. Users note that the system appears sensitive to lighting, angle and expression rather than inherent traits, and some find the leaderboard rankings unconvincing or “janky.” Nonetheless, there is noticeable enthusiasm for the novelty of ranking oneself and peers, especially in a university setting where the site went viral. Many callers suggest providing algorithmic context and an example of the ideal face to improve transparency.

- 2001 (8086): Using DEBUG.EXE, the author jumped to the reset vector FFFF:0000, causing an immediate reboot, illustrating the real‑mode address FFFF0 where the CPU starts after reset.  
- 2006: At a bank‑software firm, the author stabilized a fragile Python installer and later joined the “Archie” team, learning PKI and MITM concepts to implement a digital‑signature feature with Bouncy Castle in Java Servlets/JSP for an e‑banking product subject to rigorous security audits.  
- 2007‑2008: While developing widgets for an OpenTV set‑top box in trimmed C, the author produced pointer‑related “spaghetti” code that crashed; a senior architect quickly identified the bug. The same architect later oversaw an animation proof‑of‑concept that succeeded in an emulator but proved infeasible on real hardware due to limited CPU/graphics performance.  
- 2009‑2015: Guidance from RSA’s Dr. Burt Kaliski led to a six‑year role focusing on parser generators, formal language tooling, and petabyte‑scale indexing/query engines.  
- 2019: During a corporate CTF, the author solved ~90 % of challenges (SQL injection, cryptography, binary exploitation) in eight hours, topping the scoreboard; colleagues attributed success to a decade of C/C++ experience.

              The comments blend humor about absurd technical encounters with mild frustration over brittle software tools, especially Python installers that demand manual fixes and hard‑coded dependencies. There is nostalgic concern about maintaining technical impressiveness with age, alongside optimism that skill can persist. Advice is offered on domain acquisition and a dev‑ops resource. Overall sentiment is mixed, combining amusement at quirky situations, irritation at recurring technical hassles, and a hopeful attitude toward continued learning and competence.

          <div class="summary-content">
            Hoot is a Spritely project enabling execution of Scheme code in WebAssembly‑capable browsers that support garbage collection. It provides a Scheme‑to‑Wasm compiler and a complete Wasm toolchain, all built atop Guile with no external dependencies. The toolchain includes a Wasm interpreter, allowing Hoot binaries to be tested directly from the Guile REPL. The current stable release is version 0.7.0, with source and development versions available via Git. Documentation, announcements, and related articles or videos are linked from the project page. An accompanying logo image is also provided.

              Comments show enthusiasm for recent Guile developments and the resurgence of WebAssembly language support, with interest in using the compiled output on platforms like Cloudflare Workers and avoiding JavaScript. At the same time, users express disappointment over community fragmentation, performance gaps compared to Racket, and the lack of extensive libraries. Some reflections consider broader implications for future programming languages, questioning their professional relevance and potential shift toward more explicit, error‑reducing designs. Overall sentiment blends optimism about new capabilities with criticism of existing limitations.
