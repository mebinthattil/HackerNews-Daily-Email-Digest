              The comments convey a skeptical view of the recent report, noting the domain’s very recent registration and questioning its purpose in seeking attention. Critics highlight the absence of specific model details, which undermines confidence in the reported figures and limits the report’s practical value. While acknowledging that many older models remain vulnerable and that security concerns are real, the discussion also includes remarks about the report’s format appearing generated or repurposed, suggesting doubts about its originality and reliability.

            Swift and Rust share many modern language features—value semantics, generics, enums with pattern matching, first‑class functions, and LLVM‑based compilation to native code and WebAssembly. Rust’s default model is low‑level, emphasizing ownership, borrowing, and explicit “move” semantics, with utilities like `Rc`, `Arc`, and `Cow` for reference counting and copy‑on‑write. Swift adopts a high‑level, value‑type‑by‑default approach, providing automatic copy‑on‑write, optional types (`T?`), and an “ownership” system that can be enabled for performance. Both expose unsafe pointers for low‑level access and use similar error‑handling concepts: Rust’s `Result` and Swift’s `do‑catch` with `try`. Swift’s syntax hides many of these concepts behind familiar C‑style constructs (e.g., `switch` instead of `match`). Swift includes additional high‑level facilities such as classes, async‑await, actors, property wrappers, and result builders, while Rust remains more minimal. Performance is generally higher in Rust by default; Swift prioritizes developer convenience. Both languages now target multiple platforms, including Windows, Linux, and WebAssembly.

              Comments present a mixed view of Swift. Users acknowledge its clean syntax, convenient defaults, and strong support for Apple‑centric UI development, but repeatedly criticize Xcode’s instability, limited tooling, slow build times, and poor cross‑platform ecosystem. Performance cliffs, heavy type‑inference costs, and inadequate package management are cited as practical drawbacks. Compared to Rust, Swift is seen as easier for beginners yet lacking zero‑cost abstractions, mature tooling, and open‑source governance, making Rust the preferred choice for server‑side, systems, or multi‑platform projects. Overall sentiment leans toward appreciation for Swift’s ergonomics within Apple contexts while highlighting significant limitations elsewhere.

            Apple’s iOS 26.3 adds a privacy option that blocks cellular networks from receiving precise GNSS (GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, BeiDou) coordinates via the modem introduced in 2025. Historically, carriers have obtained location through two mechanisms: (1) coarse positioning from cell‑tower triangulation, accurate to tens‑hundreds of metres; and (2) control‑plane protocols that request the device’s GNSS fix. In 2G/3G this uses the Radio Resources LCS Protocol (RRLP); in 4G/5G it uses LTE Positioning Protocol (LPP). These protocols operate invisibly to users, allowing carriers to supply single‑digit‑metre accuracy when they query the phone. The capability has been employed by law‑enforcement agencies (e.g., U.S. DEA in 2006) and national security services (e.g., Israel’s GSS tool) to collect precise location data, including for COVID‑19 contact tracing. The new iOS setting lets users disable GNSS responses to carriers and receive notifications of such requests, aiming to curb mass surveillance that leverages these built‑in positioning protocols.

              The comments express strong concern about pervasive location tracking by carriers and device software, emphasizing that users lack clear control or notification when precise GPS data is shared and calling for stronger accountability and the ability to disable sharing with real‑time alerts. Contributors note that such tracking has existed for years, primarily for emergency services, and that carriers can also infer location via tower triangulation. Technical workarounds, including mesh‑network alternatives and settings to limit precise location, are discussed alongside suggestions for stricter privacy legislation and broader public awareness.

            William Foege, a key figure in the global eradication of smallpox, died at age 89 on Saturday, according to the Task Force for Global Health, which he co‑founded. In the 1970s he led the U.S. CDC’s Smallpox Eradication Program, contributing to the disease’s official elimination in 1980 after it had killed roughly one‑third of infected individuals; no new cases have occurred since 1977. Afterward Foege served as CDC director, senior medical adviser and senior fellow at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and received the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2012. He remained an outspoken advocate for vaccines, co‑authoring a 2013 Scientific American article on polio eradication and, in 2025, joined former CDC directors in a New York Times op‑ed criticizing the policies of HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Colleagues remembered him as an inspirational leader whose vision reinforced public‑health optimism.

              Comments emphasize the 2003 smallpox vaccination effort as a notable public‑health achievement, highlighting its scale, the involvement of military personnel and healthcare volunteers, and its relative obscurity in public memory. Several remarks praise the campaign’s legacy while others question the terminology of “eradication,” suggesting “contained” better reflects ongoing vaccine needs. A tone of sarcasm appears regarding political figures linked to the program, indicating mixed sentiment that combines recognition of its significance with criticism of its portrayal and lingering implications.

              The comments express strong enthusiasm for historic computing hardware, with several contributors eager to acquire or preserve vintage items such as an Apple II and suggesting that such artifacts be donated or loaned to museums for public access. There is also interest in creative reinterpretations of classic media, as seen in a request for a Fallout 4 module with a cinematic tone, alongside a desire for obscure hardware features like a “RUB OUT” key. A few participants display confusion about technical terminology, specifically the meaning of a “computer‑rated” capacitor.

            Wiki Education, which contributes about 19 % of new active English‑Wikipedia editors, examined generative‑AI (GenAI) use in its programs from 2022‑2025. Using the detector Pangram on 3,078 articles created since 2022, 178 were flagged as AI‑generated; none pre‑ChatGPT, with a rising trend thereafter. Only 7 % of flagged articles cited fabricated sources, but more than two‑thirds failed verification—claims were cited to real‑looking sources that did not actually contain the information. Staff devoted extensive effort to sandbox reverts, stub‑ification, and PRODs. In response, Wiki Education integrated real‑time Pangram alerts into its Dashboard, issued automated warnings, and added a training module emphasizing “no copy‑paste from GenAI”. In the latter half of 2025, 1,406 AI alerts were generated (22 % in live articles); only 5 % of participants had main‑space alerts and 3 % triggered multiple alerts. Surveys of 102 students showed 87 % found AI useful for research tasks (gap identification, source discovery, outlining) but none used it to draft text. The organization concludes GenAI should not generate Wikipedia prose; it can assist in research if human verification is applied. Wiki Education will continue using Pangram, refine detection, and expand AI‑literacy training, while recommending broader adoption of detection tools and clearer newcomer guidance on Wikipedia.

              Comments emphasize that unreliable citations and verification failures have long plagued Wikipedia, with many editors adding plausible‑sounding references without checking the sources. The recent study showing a high rate of unverifiable claims in AI‑flagged articles is seen as highlighting an existing systemic weakness rather than a novel AI‑specific problem. Participants note the labor‑intensive effort required to correct such errors, acknowledge defensive reactions that downplay the issue, and mention alternative platforms adopting AI‑first strategies, reflecting concern over both human and AI contributions to misinformation.

            The author describes adding a ‑dry‑run option to a reporting application that generates daily reports, zips them, uploads them via SFTP, processes server responses, and sends notification emails. The ‑dry‑run mode logs each step—identifying which reports would be created, which files would be zipped or moved, and what would be uploaded or downloaded—without performing any actions. This feature proved valuable for daily development, allowing quick sanity checks of configuration, data accessibility, and state consistency, and for testing changes (e.g., modifying report state dates) without incurring the time cost of full execution. The primary drawback is modest code duplication: each major phase must conditionally skip actual work when the flag is set, though core report‑generation logic remains unchanged. The author concludes that ‑dry‑run is well‑suited to command‑driven, state‑changing utilities but less applicable to reactive, message‑driven programs, and that early implementation maximized its benefits.

              Comments generally view dry‑run flags as useful safeguards that enable safe testing and verification before destructive actions, especially in CLI tools and migration scripts. Many favor a default‑safe mode requiring an explicit commit or ‑‑wet‑run flag, while others propose three‑state designs with prompts or ‑‑yes options. Implementations that separate side‑effects via injectable strategies or logging are praised for reducing code clutter. Some note increased complexity for multi‑step operations and suggest alternative approaches such as overlay filesystems. Overall sentiment is supportive of dry‑run functionality, emphasizing clear, explicit activation.

              The comments blend humor with admiration for James Mickens’s writing, noting his style as entertaining and influential. They acknowledge Byzantine fault tolerance as a practical but complex concept, often framed sarcastically as an obstacle when dealing with untrustworthy participants. Several remarks favor trust‑based approaches for business applications, suggesting they simplify system design compared to Byzantine solutions. Overall, the tone is light‑hearted yet appreciative, with a consensus that while Byzantine methods have merit, trust‑centric designs are preferable when feasible.

            Germany’s 2023 potato harvest hit a 25‑year high, producing a surplus dubbed the “Kartoffel‑Flut.” A single farmer near Leipzig offered 4,000 tonnes, prompting a Berlin newspaper and the eco‑non‑profit search engine Ecosia to coordinate free distribution at 174 pop‑up sites across the city. Around 3,200 tonnes remain available for collection. Recipients include soup kitchens, homeless shelters, schools, churches, the Berlin zoo (which diverted potatoes from landfill or biogas to animal feed), and two lorry loads sent to Ukraine. Residents, facing rising living costs, queued with bags, buckets or handcarts to collect the tubers. The initiative has sparked community interaction, recipe sharing, and media attention to the potato’s historical role in German nutrition. Critics—local farmers and environmental lobbyists—argue the giveaway depresses market prices and reflects systemic overproduction driven by past EU surplus‑purchase guarantees. The campaign is slated to conclude in the coming days.

              Comments note that German potato prices remain low and stable, creating a notable surplus that has even strained bio‑fuel capacity. Participants discuss the agricultural realities of seasonal supply, farmer income pressures, and the potential for financial products such as tokenized ETFs, while many express skepticism toward artificial scarcity. There is interest in potato varieties, preservation methods, and the impact of organic transitions on market pricing. Overall, the tone mixes factual observations of abundance with cautious concern about market manipulation and farmer viability.
